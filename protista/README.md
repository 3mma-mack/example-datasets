# Protista - other eukaryotes

Example riboviz workflows from eukaryotes that aren't animals, plants, or fungi.
This may be convenient, despite protista being a dated and polyphyletic category.
Please file a github issue to suggest a change.

Within this, please arrange workflows into subfolders by genus (Toxo, Plasmodium. etc.)
