These files hold annotations and ORF sequences.

These files were created as follows:

* [ ]

* [ ]

The sequence and annotation files for the whole approximate Cryptococcus neoformans transcriptome were prepared using: [ ]   

These annotation files were run with H99_rrna.fasta contaminants file.

These were run through Riboviz [2.0] tagged master branch, commit: [ ]
