# Simulated

Example riboviz workflows from simulated and otherwise artificial datasets, that don't come from a complete real genome.

These might be completely simulated datasets, or transcriptomes that are so radically downsampled that it doesn't make sense to include them in the folder with the original.

These might be used to test features of the pipeline.

## Structure

Since simulated datasets are not arranged by kingdom and genus, we need to suggest how to organise this. 
Please choose an informative sensible name, or file an issue with a general suggestion.
